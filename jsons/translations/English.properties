Your role in guiding the Crusaders during the sacking of Constantinople led to an even greater expansion of your power, and secured your legacy throughout history. =

Greetings, noble Hiawatha, leader of the mighty Iroquois nations! Long have your people lived near the great and holy lake Ontario in the land that has come to be known as the New York state in North America. In the mists of antiquity, the five peoples of Seneca, Onondaga, Mohawks, Cayugas and Oneida united into one nation, the Haudenosaunee, the Iroquois. With no written language, the wise men of your nation created the great law of peace, the model for many contitutions including that of the United States. For many years, your people battled great enemies, such as the Huron, and the French and English invaders. Tought outnumbered and facing weapons far more advanced than the ones your warriors wielded, the Iroquois survived and prospered, until they were finally overwhelmed by the mighty armies of the new United States. =

Reformation refers to a great movement to reform a religious organization or belief system that is seen to have become corrupt or to have strayed from its guiding principles. The "Protestant Reformation" was a movement to reform the Roman Catholic Church. Begun in 1517 when Martin Luther published "The Ninety-Five Theses" listing the Church's transgressions as he saw them; the movement sparked some 130 years of horrible, bloody religious warfare across Europe and in the New World. As a result, Christianity was permanently fractured into various different organizations and civil authority gained ultimate primacy over religious life. =

Nutmeg trees are evergreens indigenous to the Banda Islands in Indonesia. Nutmeg has been used in the culinary culture of several civilizations for centuries. In Penang cuisine it is often boiled or blended as a drink; in India it used as a sweet; and in Middle Eastern cooking it is used to spice savory dishes. But it was the discovery of the source of nutmeg in Indonesia in 1511 AD by the Portuguese explorer Albuquerque that set off the rush to import the spice to the tables of Europe. =

Cloves are the dried flower bud from a tree native to the Maluku Islands in Indonesia; an aromatic spice, it is used in cuisines worldwide. Now harvested primarily in Indonesia, India, Zanzibar and Madagascar, cloves have a numbing effect on mouth tissues and have been used in the past as a medicine and a drug as well as a spice. Until planted outside the islands, the Dutch East India Company had a virtual monopoly on the spice; in Europe in the 17th and 18th centuries, cloves were quite literally worth their weight in gold due to the demand. =

Pepper, in many forms, has been grown virtually everywhere in the world and used for millennia to season our food. Black peppercorns were found in the nostrils of Ramesses II, part of the mummification process. It has been used in Southeast Asian cuisine since the 2nd century BC. Archaeological finds indicate that various hot peppers were used by the Aztecs and Mayans in cooking. In Rome, so valuable was pepper that it was used as collateral for loans, and Attila demanded a ton of pepper to spare the city in the 5th Century AD. Pepper has justifiably been called the "king of spice." =
