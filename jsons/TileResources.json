Archaeological finds indicate that various hot peppers were used by the Aztecs and Mayans in cooking. In Rome, so valuable was pepper that it was used as collateral for loans, and Attila demanded a ton of pepper to spare the city in the 5th Century AD. Pepper has justifiably been called the \"king of spice.\"" }
